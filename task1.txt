The state is encoded as a JSON string and sent via UDP. 
Example: {"alice": 22, "bob": 35, "carol": 15}

To ensure safe transmission over the Internet, the UDP payload is limited to 576 bytes.
The JSON string must therefore not exceed 576 bytes.

Number of participants:
Assuming each entry is ~20 bytes on average, the system can safely support around:

576 bytes / 20 bytes ≈ 28 participants
To be safe, limit to around 20–25 participants.
